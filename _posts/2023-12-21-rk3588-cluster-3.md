I've got the hardware for the Cluster Box fully documented and I'm now ready to begin setup. Here I'm going to cover the  first boot up of the cluster, and document my setup process.

<!--more-->

## Lights, camera, action
Following the provided installation guide, I plugged only the power adapter into the box and waited. The barrel jack is about 5mm too long for the jack, so it doesn't feel like it is firmly locked in place. After a couple of seconds, the fans ramped up. About thirty seconds later the light on the front of each tray lit up. Over the next several minutes these toggled on and off, with the fans periodically ramping up and down again. Unfortunately there is no clear external indication that all the nodes have booted properly.

After waiting a few minutes for all the nodes to (hopefully) come up, I connected the box to my desktop via a Cat 5 cable attached to the control board RJ-45 jack. Unfortunately it looks like either OpenWRT is not configured as a DHCP server out of the box. Instead, it sends a DHCP discovery request every 3 seconds:

{% include img.html href="/assets/images/2023-12-21-rk3588-cluster-3/wireshark-1.png" alt="Lots and lots of DHCP requests" %}

Fortunately it looks like it is (in some manner) already configured, as option 12 of the DHCP request lists the host name as `MixtileClusterBox`.

I use Windows as my desktop OS, and I'm using it for my initial setup of the box. I set a static IP address on the NIC that the box is plugged into, then I used [this DHCP server project](https://www.dhcpserver.de/cms/) to host a temporary DHCP server. I used the following config:

```ini
[SETTINGS]
IPPOOL_1=10.32.0.2-255
;This is the IP address I assigned to my NIC
IPBIND_1=10.32.0.1
AssociateBindsToPools=1
Trace=1
DeleteOnRelease=0
ExpiredLeaseTimeout=3600

[GENERAL]
LEASETIME=86400
NODETYPE=8
SUBNETMASK=255.255.255.0
NEXTSERVER=10.32.0.1
DNS_0=1.1.1.1
DNS_1=10.32.0.1
DNS_2=8.8.8.8
ROUTER_0=10.3.0.1

[DNS-SETTINGS]
EnableDNS=1
FORWARD=1.1.1.1
```

Almost immediately after starting the DHCP server service, the cluster box requested and received an IP address. Afterwards I was able to communicate with the OpenWRT box:

{% include img.html href="/assets/images/2023-12-21-rk3588-cluster-3/openwrt-1.png" alt="HTTP request success" %}

The default username and password for both OpenWRT web access and SSH access are `mixtile` and `mixtile`.

Upon login I am greeted with a standard OpenWRT status page. Here's a summary:
* Kernel version: 5.10.161
* Firmware version: mixtile-cluster-box-v0.0.2-20230922 / LuCI openwrt-22.03
* RAM usage: 90 MB (about 36%)
* Disk usage: 352 KB (about 5%)

It also looks like four DHCP leases have been issued:

{% include img.html href="/assets/images/2023-12-21-rk3588-cluster-3/openwrt-2.png" alt="For some reason only the third Blade has reported it's hostname" %}

The routing page shows that the control board can communicate with both the host and the Blades, which contradicts my previous understanding that the the 2.5GBase-T port on each Blade must be used for external traffic. The downside is that the link is slow... very slow. My Windows hosts reports that it was only able to establish a 100Mbps link rather than the documented 1Gbps speed.

## Well, it worked for a few minutes
Halfway through reading through the OpenWRT settings, the entire Cluster Box reset. Note that I have the box plugged into a (working) UPS, so I think that it is very unlikely that this was caused by a power outage. It appeared to do this several times back to back. When it finally came back up, the OpenWRT status page was blank. Additionally, the routing table is now empty.


1. Saved config
2. Rebooted via UI
3. 20m later does not appear to be online
4. Waited another 30m, and pulled the plug.
5. I'm now getting `/usr/lib/lua/luci/dispatcher.lua:431: /etc/config/luci seems to be corrupt, unable to find section 'main'` when I attempt to load the login page, and the box sends a TCP reset during the SSH handshake. (wireshark-2.png)
6. Powered off via plug, pulled the node, can now suddenly log in via web interface but not SSH. Dropbear pagefault:
```
[   73.345256] do_page_fault(): sending SIGSEGV to 5 for invalid read access from 4d5b234c

```

```

Lots of:

```

```<4>[   18.954241] miop: module license 'MIXTILE' taints kernel.```



*** it looks like the cluster box is vulnerable to CLI injection attacks, see dmesg.js on kernel log page load

System log page doesn't work due to ubus request calling rpc endpoint that doesnt exist (?)
/sbin/syslogger -e ^ works via API though

The restore logic just does `tar -tzf` on the archive, which will overwrite any files on the system
